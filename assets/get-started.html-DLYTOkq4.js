The author has recently encountered that when Alipay connects to the national medical insurance interface, the medical insurance interface requires interface encryption.</p><p>Therefore, in view of the existence of this demand, the author also looked for some of the current interface encryption components and found that they had stopped updating 3.4 years ago, and did not accept PR or reply to issues. They were also simple and complex to use, so they developed a new set of components.</p><p>The author does not know much about the various requirements of interface encryption.
